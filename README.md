# Chuck-Norris-Jokes-App
This is an App that displays Chuck Norris related jokes!

The jokes are fetched from this api: https://api.chucknorris.io/

Personally the purpose of this app is to make me familiar with the syntax of Kotlin
As well as using Retrofit for making HTTP request and SharedPreference for persistent storage.
